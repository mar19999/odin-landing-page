# odin-landing-page

This is a webpage built as part of the Landing Page project from **The Odin Project** Foundations Course.

## Project Overview

In this project, I created a webpage based on a design provided in the course. The goal was to apply what was learned in **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on **Flexbox** for layout styling.
